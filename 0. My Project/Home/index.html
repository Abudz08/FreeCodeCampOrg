            <p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">"H</strong>ey there! I'm Abdulrahman Tabao. Though my official birthday says October 6th, 1988, there's a bit of a mystery surrounding my actual birthdate. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is definitely my birthplace, but some documents whisper a different story - Marawi City, a year earlier.  While the full picture remains unclear, it's a fun fact that sparks conversation, and hey, it makes me a year younger legally! "</p>

            "My educational journey started at JPI (Jamiatu Philippine al-Islamia) from kindergarten to grade 4. In grade 5, I transferred to APCES (Amai Pakpak Central Elementary School) and discovered a talent for academics, becoming the top student in my class! I graduated from APCES in 2000 with a newfound confidence in my abilities."

            "High school was an exciting time! I set a challenging goal to attend Science Training Center Marawi City, a renowned science high school. While I wouldn't say I was surrounded by geniuses only (wink), I was lucky to be accepted. After a year, I decided to transfer to Krus na Ligas High School (KNLHS) in Diliman, Quezon City, closer to home. I graduated from KNLHS in 2004 with second honors, marking the end of another chapter in my life."
